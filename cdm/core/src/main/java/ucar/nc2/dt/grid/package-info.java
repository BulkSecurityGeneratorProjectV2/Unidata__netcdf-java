 * DEPRECATED API - WILL BE REPLACED: Scientific data type "Grid", uses cartesian coordinate system.

 * A <b><i>grid</i></b> has
 * a georeferencing &quot;gridded&quot; CoordinateSystem, which implies a connected
 * topology such that values next to each other in index space are next to each
 * other in coordinate space. In the VisAD data model, a grid is a sampled Field.
 * <i> <b>Note: these classes should be considered experimental and may be refactored
